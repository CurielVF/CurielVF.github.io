# Personal Portfolio

This is my professional portfolio, built as a single-page website.  
The goal is to present a clean and modern overview of who I am, the kind of work I do, and how to get in touch.

## Overview

The portfolio is structured into a few simple sections:

- **About Me**: short description of my background and focus.
- **Projects**: three placeholders ready to be filled with real case studies.
- **Contact**: email and social links (LinkedIn, GitHub).

## Features

- Responsive design (works on desktop and mobile).
